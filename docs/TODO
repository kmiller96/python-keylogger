Fixes:
    [X] Remove "shift" keypresses from log (it's captured in the logged character)
    [X] Replace "space" with an actual whitespace character.
    [X] Get the keylogger to be a separate thread (required so that it can count down and log after defined amount of time)

Upgrades:
    [X] Log text typed in quick succession as a single line.
    [ ] Better interpret character combos (e.g. CTRL+C, CTRL+V, ALT+TAB, etc.).
    [ ] Replace capitalised characters (S) with a control code (shift+s) if they are single-character logs.
    [X] Replace "enter" with "[ENTER]\n"
    [X] For quick-succession writes, let the backspace character _remove_ keypresses
    [X] Configure the keylogger using an ini file.

Extensions:
    [X] Log keypresses to a file instead of STDOUT.
    [ ] Figure out if using VIM bindings instead of actual typing text.
